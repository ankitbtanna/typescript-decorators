Learning TypeScript Decorators

## What are TypeScript decorators?
- A way to **observe, modify and replace** - **class declarations and members**.
- What: classes, properties, methods, accessors(getter setter) and parameters
- A way to provide annotations and a meta programming syntax for classes and members

### Sample Class
```javascript
class Vehicle {
    brand: string;
    color: string;
    isRegistered: boolean;

    constructor(brand: string, color: string, isRegistered: boolean) {
        this.brand = brand;
        this.color = color;
        this.isRegistered = isRegistered;
    }

    showDetails(): void {
        console.log(`The car is of ${this.brand} and ${this.color}.`)
    }
}
```


```javascript
